Usability
===============================

Instagram
learnability (first time of access):

The site itself has one ground goal, to show and view images and posts from users. It is very simple and down to the utterly needed functions. The site is very alike the app version, which was the first version of Instagram. First time you enter, you will be told you log into your account. There is not that much that can go wrong. You are also told to get the app version on your smartphone if you do not already have it there. Instagram builds on you being logged in, having your own feed of images and information and therefor an account is needed. For a beginner, an account might be a bit tricky to create, however if you have a bit of computer knowledge this won’t be a problem. Buttons are easy to locate and use. When you logged in, you are greeted with your personalized feed. When you are here, you can just start to scroll to view your feed.

Efficiency (after a bit of use):

After a bit of usage, you access other small features such as liking, commenting and following. These buttons are fairly visible, just below the posts. If you are new, you focus might be on the images. There is also a small button which leads you to your account and your posted images. You can also access your history (who liked your posts) and a discover page, where you are introduced to nearby and friends friends. As mentioned before, the website on its own is a re-creation of the app version.

Memorability: (After a while):

Since the site is easy to use to begin with, all functions will come back to you after a short while of use. There are no in-depth functions you will need to remember, nor any difficult pathing or searching. The only thing that might be gone when you return is your saved account details on the log in screen. All you need to remember is your login details.

Errors (few, severe):

There is almost not possibly to do wrong. The content on the site is minimized only to its goal and therefor not much can go wrong. The only small problem that we noticed was that in order to log out, you first had to locate you profile, press the 3 little dots next to your profile to log out.

Satisfaction (pleasant?):

The goal of the site is to view images and posts. It does that just lovely. It is so simple yet useful and it has got all the features you might need. The site might have been more complexed if it was first structured on the computer. however since they want it to look alike the app version, and since it is on the phone with a smaller screen there are simply no place for more functions.

Prisjakt
Learnability (First time of access):
The page has two functions. Either you visit it because you want to find the lowest price on a product you already found or you are looking for a new product and need help browsing. If you know the product, you simply enter the name of the product at the top and you are shown the cheapest shop at the top and the most expensive at the bottom. You can filter it by store, store grade, price, if it’s in stock and price with shipping.

However, if you visit the page when you currently are browsing after an item you can pick a category at the start page which is fine. But after you’ve selected the product “family” you want to browse, you’re greeted with an overwhelming amount of items and a not so well design filter function.

The filter offers a guide which makes you choose filters in a more user-friendly way which is a great new addition to the website.

Efficiency (After a bit of use):
As a person who uses this page frequently, I’ve learned the filter function well and how to use it on the products I usually browse. I rarely just scroll through the entire list because I mostly know all the specifications on the product I want to buy. If you have the knowledge about the product you want to browse, it’s an amazing website to browse which products you have to choose from. However, if you’re browsing a new item (say microwaves for me) then I don’t have a single clue on what I want my microwave to have and hence I will be lost in the filters even though I’m used to the website.

Memorability: (After a while):

The page often changes how it filters things so if you don’t visit it more than a couple of times a year then you will be lost once more. However, if you use it more frequently than that, say every few weeks, you will have no issue remembering how to use the website.

Errors (few, severe):

Every so often I manage to enable two filters that contradicts each other (say I want a screen that’s 16:9 but I also entered a 16:10 resolution, which isn’t possible). The website often lacks ways to deny the user to enter two contradicting filters which could be frustrating at best. It’s also very easy to get lost in all the specifications that exists and depending on what product you’re browsing, it can be a lot of them. However, it is quite easy to remove filters you have entered as they are shown at the top with a simple “X” next to them.

Satisfaction (pleasant?):
The design overall is pleasant to use but the filter part could need (another) visual update. The grid of images of the products makes it a lot easier to browse after products you find visually appealing. The colors used on the website co-exists well with another and gives the website overall a bright and professional look.

Netflix
Learnability (first time of access):
Netflix is a movie and series based website. As a user, you want to be able to stream quality content easy and direct from your device. At first sight, you are introduced with a big logo and a picture of a bit of their collection. The website is based on a monthly payment which will require a basic knowledge in online purchasing. After login, you can now access all of their content. Either you can go ahead and search right away if you have got a title, or you can try some of the suggested items. One of Netflix big sales pitch, is that you can start watch where you ended last time. This might be a bit confusing in the beginning with red bars going across some videos.

Efficiency (after a bit of use):
After a bit of you, Netflix will also start adapting after your choices. If you watch a lot of action movies, other similar movies will be promoted to you on the start screen which you can watch if you do not have anything specific in mind. Since there is a lot of content, it might be hard at first to comprehend and use it all. The more you use it, and look around, the more you will find. There is a basic filter where you can search for genres as well as new content.

Memorability: (After a while):

After a while, you might comeback and not recognize the site. They often change their background depending on your prefers. If you don’t watch for a while, they might randomize a movie to be the background.
Also, you have to remember your log in details.

Errors (few, severe):

The site is fairly big, therefor has been looked through thoroughly. I can not find any errors, small nor big. One thing I know was a bit tricky was that on a smart-tv. I tried to start an already watched show on it however after a few second it sent me back to the menu (since they movie had ended). I had to quickly press the rewind button. I could also not “restart the video” but rewind the whole thing and that took some time.

Satisfaction (pleasant?):
As a user, I am really pleased with the site. I love the feature that it starts where it ended last time. The layout is good swell as the content. They have fulfilled their sales pitch.

￼CurseForge
learnability (first time of access):

CurseForge offers a great modding environment for several games, where Minecraft and World of Warcraft are two of the most popular ones. The website itself has a clear pick on which game you want to mod and if you want to check out mods/addons, they are easy to find by either browsing through the sub-filters. You can also browse via game version, popularity, recently updated and total downloads, making it easy to find addons with good support.

Efficiency (after a bit of use):

Once you are used to the site, you will find it easy to navigate each of the games. You will have no issue following the development of the addons/mods you like and you might even find one or two new to add to your collection. It is easy for you to see change logs to see if the problem you addressed has been fixed and the overall experience is good.

Memorability: (After a while):

They recently changed their design completely since they grew larger as a cooperation and community. But since the rework, not much has changed and it is as easy to navigate after two weeks as it is after two hours.

Errors (few, severe):

I rarely make errors at this website since most of the information is quite clear on what you are doing. One thing that does bother me though is how difficult it is for me as a user to go between the different games. If you entered the Minecraft subpage, you must go back to the main site (curseforge.com) to be able to get to say the World of Warcraft page.

Satisfaction: Satisfaction (pleasant?):

The design changes depending on what subpage you are on and I feel that the small change in colors helps me keep track of which game I am currently browsing. The page design overall is great, it is stylish and convenient and I feel that they did a great job with the rework as the old page was far more difficult to use.
