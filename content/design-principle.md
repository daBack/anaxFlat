This is the site where I found the principe:
[Design principes](https://designschool.canva.com/design-elements-principles/)

##Color
In this theme, I am using a strong color palette. This makes the site scream a bit more. What I did do was use a triad color palette.

If the website only has got a content of text, it looks like a few colors was thrown together. However if the site had a message, for example an exotic drink, this could be a perfect
way of giving the user a taste of what "the company" is producing.

##Framing
Framing is a really sweet tool, to redirect the eye where you want it to focus. For example if you have a website and you have got a special message you want all users to see, you can give it a frame. In my opinion, it focuses on something important.

##Texure
I chose to use a forest and wood as my texture. This might be a good idea if you have a theme message on your site. For example if you are against chopping down the rainforest, you might have a beautiful image that catches the eye. Also show an "after picture" to create drama.
Also if you want a classy polo site, the images might contain horses and go in the colors of the team.

I like this theme type the most since you can you an image that mirrors the content instead of lots of text. Of course text is needed but this gives the user a though even before he starts to read the content.

##Comp Theme
In this theme, I worked in the 1 and the 7 criteria. I created a winter theme, with a photo as background and complementary. The content of the site is also centered in the middle. What I understood with recurring image, I see it in the way that not the image has to be used more than once, but different images.

##Comp Theme 2
In this theme, I worked in the 2 and the 6 criteria. First of all, I felt that a brick photo symbolizes structure. Thereafter I tried to made sure that the container filled 100% of the site. I did make sure to keep the flash bar in the middle so that it still had some kind of structure with the menu on top. Also the 5. I could not match the lines with the background, however they both give the impression of "grid structure".

##Comp Theme 3
The last theme builds in the 3 and 4 criteria. I created a gradient background in blue. I also reused it on the footer.
Since I wanted the opacity in as well, I decided not to do a background color on the wrapper but on the images instead. Since the photo and flash bar takes up a lot of place, I thought that it would create a nice effect

I chose not to implement the eighth criteria since I did not understand it. If I was supposed to have several background images or one that was made up of several small ones.
